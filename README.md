# COMP4710-Group-11

## TODO
- Decide how assocation rules and random forest are connected
  - Association rules for analysis part of paper, then random forest for prediction?
  - Decide on order of implementation: data mining then prediciton? or vise versa
- Choose algorithm to mine data
- What are the main areas of work, and how will we divide the work among the group
  - Compile all datasets into CSV/spreadsheet for use in project and submiting
    - is this even necessary?
  - Implement data mining algorithm
  - Implement random forest algorithm
  - Perform analysis on dataset, association rules, and results of prediction algorithm
  - Write report (10 page minimum using [IEEE template 2-column](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html))
  - Presentation (video or live powerpoint)
