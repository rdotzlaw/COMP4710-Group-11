### DELIVERABLE

A project report (e.g., at least 10 pages when using the IEEE template 2-column). You are strongly encouraged to use this template containing the following sections:

- introduction (includes motivation, potential real-life applications). At the end of the Introduction (say, Section 1.1), pls explicitly list your contributions of this work (e.g., a new design, an efficient algorithm, additional features, new insights)
- Background & related work (e.g., point out shortcomings of the existing work, compare & contrast with the existing work)
- main body (includes description of your new idea, step-by-step illustrative examples, pseudo codes, highlight of any differences between your work vs. existing works)
- analytical (e.g., theorems) and empirical evaluation (e.g., experiments, tables & figures, explanations on experimental results)
- conclusions, limitations, and future work
- references (e.g., cite at least 10 refereed books, journals, and/or conference papers; websites do NOT counted)

Please also submit the source of the report, i.e., either (1) MS Word document or (2) LaTeX source (e.g., LaTeX file and figures, Excel files for figures).

Please see sample project reports.

For proof-of-concept implementation, in addition to the above report, also submit

- source code (preferably, in C/C++ programming language if efficiency is a concern/focus; otherwise, programming languages like C#, Java, Python, R, Scala are ok too),
- a README file on how to execute the codes, and
- CSV/Excel file(s) producing the tables and/or plotted figures/graphs in the Experimental Evaluation section (so that we could modify/redraw the figures)

A 8-10min presentation highlighting your project.
