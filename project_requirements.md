### OVERVIEW

Data mining refers to the non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data. This project gives COMP 4710 students a chance to get a deeper understanding on some topics at a level suitable for undergraduate students.

### GROUP SIZE

Each group is expected to consist of 3-4 students.

### POTENTIAL TOPICS

Topics for the project include, but not limited to, either (1) development of new ideas related to or (2) extension to, existing algorithms in the following area:

- Frequent sub-graph mining, direct acyclic graph (DAG) mining, mining interaction patterns
- Fuzzy-set or rough-set approaches for frequent pattern mining
- Share-frequent pattern mining
- Weighted frequent pattern mining
- High utility pattern mining
- Hyper-linked structure frequent pattern mining
- Emerging/contrast pattern mining
- Probabilistic-frequent pattern (p-FP) mining
- Quantitative association rule mining
- Big data mining (with Spark, MapReduce, cloud computing, fog or edge computing)
- Social network mining (e.g., opinion mining, collaborative filtering, community detection)
- Blockchain data mining
- Mining fake news farm
- Privacy-preserving data mining
- Text mining, Web mining
- Rare pattern mining, anomaly detection
- Clustering and classification
- Bio-medical data mining
- Incremental and interactive mining
- Visual analytics

### DUE DATE

Electronic submission by () at 13:30 CST

### DELIVERABLE

A project report (e.g., at least 10 pages when using the IEEE template 2-column). You are strongly encouraged to use this template containing the following sections:

- introduction (includes motivation, potential real-life applications). At the end of the Introduction (say, Section 1.1), pls explicitly list your contributions of this work (e.g., a new design, an efficient algorithm, additional features, new insights)
- Background & related work (e.g., point out shortcomings of the existing work, compare & contrast with the existing work)
- main body (includes description of your new idea, step-by-step illustrative examples, pseudo codes, highlight of any differences between your work vs. existing works)
- analytical (e.g., theorems) and empirical evaluation (e.g., experiments, tables & figures, explanations on experimental results)
- conclusions, limitations, and future work
- references (e.g., cite at least 10 refereed books, journals, and/or conference papers; websites do NOT counted)

Please also submit the source of the report, i.e., either (1) MS Word document or (2) LaTeX source (e.g., LaTeX file and figures, Excel files for figures).

Please see sample project reports.

For proof-of-concept implementation, in addition to the above report, also submit

- source code (preferably, in C/C++ programming language if efficiency is a concern/focus; otherwise, programming languages like C#, Java, Python, R, Scala are ok too),
- a README file on how to execute the codes, and
- CSV/Excel file(s) producing the tables and/or plotted figures/graphs in the Experimental Evaluation section (so that we could modify/redraw the figures)

A 8-10min presentation highlighting your project.
